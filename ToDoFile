- instead of console app which starts at start up of pc, it can be used as windows service
- instead of sending IP everytime the pc starts, comparing the current IP adress to earlier IP adress which is saved in some file, 
  if the current IP is different then it file gets overwritten and a mail is sent, else nothing happens
